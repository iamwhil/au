<h1>Background and Justification</h1>
This repository is a collection of my solutions to the Ashford University Computer Software Technology curriculum.  As I complete work I will keep this repository updated.
I'm currently a full time developer with many years of experience, therefore, some of my solutions to earlier assigments may utilize constructs other students may not know of, ex: functions in the early assignements to keep code clean.
I've tried to address the assignments as clearly as possible and utilize clean coding practices and constructs covered in the chapters.

<h2>CPT 200</h2>
CPT 200 is the introduction to programmin in Python.  It covers:

* Chapter 1 - Introduction to Python
* Chapter 2 - Variables and Expressions
* Chapter 3 - Types
* Chapter 4 - Branching (if / then / else / elif statements)
* Chapter 1 - Loops (for and while loops)
* Chapter 6 - Functions (this chapter does a poor job of explaining scope! The MIT lecture below does a much better job!)
* Chapter 7 - Strings
* Chapter 8 - Lists and Dictionaries (enumerateable things, a more indepth look than chapter 3 provides)
* Chapter 9 - Exception Handling (Defines its own custom classes in the reading with no concept of classes)
* Chapter 10 - File I/O

There is no real lecture or commentary by the current professor, and the majority of the content is covered by the reading.

Overall I think the set of assignements 1 - 5 was a decent exercise.
It covered things and incorporated new ideas fairly well as the reading progressed.
However, it did omit quite a bit.

I think having a section on error handling would have been great.  For example
it would have been great to have assignment 4 or 5 check to make sure that the
input for the employee salary is actually a number, and then gracefully fail if not.
I also understand that this course is only 5 weeks long and covers 10 chapters in 
the book, but it seems that quite a few people's understangings of the material 
(from what I've heard) is lacking.

Perhaps creating lecutres or linking to Youtube videos on the content presented 
in the chapter wouldd be a great help.  This is an online school, I do not get
why there are no lecture videos.  Free online courses provide videos in addition
to the reading, assignments, problem sets, and lecture notes.

A great additional resource is: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/

Episode 4 on functions does a great job to clearly define how functions operate, formal parameters, arguments, and return statements: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjbuarJ7SE0 

* Bonus Pro Life Tip: You can watch the videos at 2x normal speed and still understand the teacher.

Additionally the reading in the later chapters starts to indroduce concepts
that have not been covered.  In particular defining custom classes for the
error handling.  Without any background in 'what is a class?' this seems 
out of the blue and inconsiderate of what has and has not been covered.
